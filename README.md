# OpenClosedFist_MachineLearning
This script captures an image of the user showing one of two symbols with their hands: open and closed fist, 

classifies it under the appropriate category 

and sends an SMS to the phone of the programmer's choice based on which category the image was classified under. 

MachineLearning4Kids was used to train the model with images of open and closed fists. 


Twilio was used to create a phone number and send out an SMS - a Twilio account is needed to send texts.
